# A-Text-Editor

## Prerequisites
**Note: Not all of these are necessary, some are here purely for convenience.**
### A Package Manager
In this guide [git (not a package manager)](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) is used.
### A C Language Compiler
### Administrator Privileges
This is needed to add an executable to the system files so that the program can be run globally by entering the 'ate' command. If this is not done, the program can only be run from its directory, however, the 'ate' command that allows the program to run globally will not work.
